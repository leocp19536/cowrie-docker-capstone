# Cowrie Docker Capstone Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Cowrie**, an interactive SSH honeypot, captured and deployed using **Docker**. Cowrie is designed to capture and log the actions of attackers attempting to compromise a system. The honeypot emulates vulnerable systems to attract attackers, thereby enabling detailed analysis of cyber threats.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive SSH Session Simulation**: Logs interactions with attackers.
- **Real-Time Data**: Captures attacks in real-time for analysis.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easy setup using Docker containers.

The goal of this capstone project is to explore cybersecurity concepts, penetration testing, and honeypot analysis for educational and research purposes.

The purpose of this capstone project is to explore cybersecurity concepts, penetration testing, and honeypot analysis.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure that you have the following tools and software installed:
- **Docker**: Docker is required to run the Cowrie honeypot in a containerized environment.
- **Kali Linux**: Used for penetration testing and simulating attacks.
- **Kali Purple**: Used for the installation of the Docker container and viewing of logs.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leocp19536/cowrie-docker-capstone.git
   cd cowrie-docker-capstone
2. Update the system:
   Ensure your virtual machine is up-to-date:
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
3. Install docker
   Install Docker on your system:
   sudo apt install -y docker.io
4. Start docker
   Enable and start the Docker service:
   sudo systemctl enable --now docker
5. Check docker version
   Verify Docker is installed correctly by checking the version:
   sudo docker --version
6. Install Cowrie docker
   Download the latest Cowrie Docker image:
   sudo docker pull cowrie/cowrie
7. To start Cowrie
   To start Cowrie Docker:
   sudo systemctl start docker
8. To check Cowrie docker is running
   To check:
   sudo docker ps
9. To check if Cowrie's log is running
   To check:
   sudo docker logs cowrie

Simulate Attacks with Kali Linux
Once you have Cowrie Docker running, you can simulate attacks from Kali Linux (or Kali Purple) to interact with the honeypot. This will allow you to test the Cowrie honeypot and observe how it logs attacker activities.

1. Install Kali Linux / Kali Purple (if not already installed)
Ensure Kali Linux or Kali Purple is set up on your machine. Kali Linux comes with pre-installed penetration testing tools like Hydra, Nmap, and Metasploit, which are essential for simulating attacks.
2.Install Attack Tools:
If you haven’t already, you can install common penetration testing tools using the following commands in Kali Linux:
Hydra: A tool for brute-forcing login credentials.
To install:
sudo apt install hydra
Nmap: A tool for network scanning and service enumeration.
sudo apt install nmap
Metasploit: A popular penetration testing framework.
sudo apt install metasploit-framework
3. Simulate a Brute-Force Attack with Hydra:
Use Hydra to perform a brute-force SSH login attack on Cowrie. For this example, we'll assume the target IP address of the Cowrie honeypot is 192.168.1.100 and we’re attempting to brute-force the root user:
hydra -l root -P /path/to/wordlist.txt ssh://192.168.1.100   
This command will try various passwords from your specified wordlist against the root SSH account on the Cowrie honeypot.
4. Scan for Open Ports with Nmap:
You can also use Nmap to scan the exposed SSH port (default: 2222) of the Cowrie honeypot to discover vulnerabilities or services.
nmap -sV -p 2222 192.168.1.100
5. Exploit the Cowrie Honeypot Using Metasploit (Optional):
Metasploit is a powerful framework for exploiting vulnerabilities. To use Metasploit with Cowrie, you would need to interact with the exposed SSH service and try to exploit any vulnerabilities.
Launch Metasploit:
msfconsole
Search for SSH exploits:
search ssh
Use an appropriate exploit module and set the target as the Cowrie honeypot.
6. Review Cowrie Logs:
After performing the attacks, you can review the logs generated by Cowrie to analyze the interaction between the attacker (you) and the honeypot.
To view the logs:
sudo docker logs cowrie
The logs will show details about login attempts, commands executed, and any other interactions with the Cowrie honeypot.
